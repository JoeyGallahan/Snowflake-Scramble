# Snowflake Scramble
 A casual browser game I made in 2014 for fun and to learn the basics of the HTML canvas. By using the mouse to move, you play as a child trying to catch as many snowflakes as you can while avoiding the falling icycles. Be careful; if you get hit by 3 icycles, then it's game over!
